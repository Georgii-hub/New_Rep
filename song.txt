Jingle Bells

Dashing through the snow 
In a one-horse open sleigh, 
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way; 
Bells on bob-tail ring, 
Making spirits bright, 
What fun it is to ride and sing 
A sleighing song tonight, O

Jingle bells, 
jingle bells, 
jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago, 
I thought Iâ€™d take a ride, 
And soon Miss Fanny Bright 
Was seated by my side; 
The horse was lean and lank; 
Mis fortune seemed his lot; 
He got into a drifted bank, 
And we, we got upset. O
